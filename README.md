# TicTakToe using Minimax
Simple game of tictaktoe using HTML, CSS, and vanillia JS. The first version of this game was created awhile ago.
That version was very simple and allowed two people to play against eachother. Quickly after that I wanted create an 
AI to play against. At first The AI picked a random spot to play. This basically made it impossible to lose against
the AI. I wanted something a little more out of the AI and looked into algorithms.

## Minimax Algorithm
Doing research I found the minimax algorith and read some articles. I had to reread them over and over before I started to grasp 
what I was doing. After implementing this algorithm the AI is pratically impossible to beat and the best I can do is tie.
Soon I will add some styling to this project but the main purpose was to start exploring algorithms and practice JS.

Give it a shot!
